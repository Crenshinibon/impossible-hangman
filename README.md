Impossible-Hangman
==================

Hangman implementation in Meteor. Does swap words. Made it in response to Olimex's Weekend Programming Challenge: http://olimex.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/weekend-programming-challenge-issue-8/

You can test it here: http://impossible-hangman.meteor.com

Feel free to use the code as you will. No guarantee is given, that it works in any way and in any situation, though.
